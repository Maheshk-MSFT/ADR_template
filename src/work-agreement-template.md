# Work agreement template

We (`Team A` and the `Team B`) will be working together for the successful implementation of `Project name`. To improve our collaboration and work in a “code-with” model, we must lay down some principles and guidelines that we follow as a team. These principles will serve as the foundation for how we engage, discuss, and resolve issues, and perform other tasks. The following document is a living document, is not meant to be exhaustive nor complete, and represents the principles and expected behavior. The team should feel empowered to speak up when any member violates the principles. The principles are **signed off** by everyone in the team.

## Principle 1: We work towards a common goal and clear scope

`Define the scope of work, Team A and Team B must be aligned with it`

We work as a team, there are no separate `Team A` or `Team B` specific goals, we succeed or fail together. Our work allocation will be driven by the Sprint planning process, story breakdown into tasks, and the assignment will be done by the team assigning tasks to themselves.

## Principle 2: Collaboration is the norm

Collaboration hours
`Capture the team members time zone and the work hours`
US West	9am – 1pm
US Central	11am – 3pm
US East	12pm – 4pm
Brazil	1pm – 5pm

Because of team member time zone spread in the East / Central/ West US regions and Brazil, please bias all critical communication / meetings to collaboration hours.

- Members of the project team will be responsive on all communications channels during collaboration hours.
- To ensure that the right people see your messages and can respond in a timely manner, please @mention the specific persons you need in your note.
- To encourage independent productivity, break stories into tasks which can be worked on independently and can be worked on during the engineer's time zone.

### Communication Norms

- We will use Microsoft Teams channels as our primary communication platform.
- Please use public channels as much as possible so that other members of the dev team can benefit from any learnings.
- Specifically, use the `Microsoft teams team name` -> General channel.
- Create a subject to your Teams post and if your post pertains to a specific workstream, use the subject line to indicate that. Example: [API] Learned cool thing about python and dependency injection
- Async communication is always encouraged where possible.
- Calls will be scheduled using Teams and recorded, as necessary.
- All relevant work item communication will be done in the work item’s comments (or other fields).
- Attend all meetings whenever possible.
- Be on time for meetings and give full attention for the duration of the meeting.
- Meetings should have agenda.
- Meetings should begin and end on time. Scheduled time for a meeting should reflect the amount of time required.
- When scheduling meetings, make sure to give a 5 minute buffer between, to allow breaks.
- If a meeting has next steps, or a decision was made during a meeting, that information will be summarized in Teams by one of the Tech Leads.
- If possible, set up meeting 12-24h in advance to allow time zone differences.

## Code Management

`Define guideline for contributing`

Follow all following guidelines defined on [contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Definition of Done (story)

1. Acceptance criteria are met
2. Refactoring is complete
3. Code builds with no error
4. Unit tests are written and pass
5. Existing Unit Tests pass
6. Sufficient diagnostics/telemetry are logged
7. Code review is complete by minimum of two team members
8. Documentation is updated
9. The feature is merged into the main branch
10. The feature is signed off by the product owner

## Pull Requests

### Reviewing

- Prioritize reviewing PRs.
- If you have paired with someone on a PR, you CANNOT review their PR.
- When reviewing a PR, make sure you review the linked story / task first, so you understand the scope of the work that was done.
- Assign a person per sprint to monitor PRs and remind team members to review PRs. This person will monitor twice daily (morning and afternoon) for submitted PRs that need reviewers and finding them, will remind via Teams – PR channel post – tagging reviewers to remind them to review. It can be helpful for the person assigned as the sprint’s `PRolice` to turn all PR channel notifications on.

### Submitting

- When submitting a PR, name the PR as follows: [parent (story-level) Product Backlog number] – title.
- When submitting a PR, please add helpful tips / information on what the reviewer should focus on and snapshots of expected behavior / output.

## Principle 3: Encourage and Support Work-Life Balance

- We are not accountable to answer emails on vacation or past core collaboration hours.
- After travel with the time zone change, core work hours are suspended for one week so that we can re-adjust back to our home time zone.
- Make sure the team is aware of your availability by updating the Availability Calendar.
